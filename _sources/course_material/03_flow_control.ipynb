        "\n",
        "So you know the basics of individual instructions and that a program is just a series of instructions. But the real strength of programming isn’t just running (or executing) one instruction after another. Based on how the expressions evaluate, the program can decide to skip instructions, repeat them, or choose one of several instructions to run. \n",
        "\n",
        "In fact, you almost never want your programs to start from the first line of code and simply execute every line, straight to the end. **Flow control** statements can decide which Python instructions to execute under which conditions.\n",
        "\n",
        "These flow control statements directly correspond to the symbols in a flowchart, so we’ll provide flowchart versions of the code discussed in this chapter. Figure below shows a flowchart for what to do if your alarm rings in the morning. Follow the path made by the arrows from *Start* to *End*.\n",
        "\n",
        "![](../images/000105.png)\n",
        "\n",
        "In a flowchart, there is usually more than one way to go from the start to the end. The same is true for lines of code in a computer program. Flowcharts represent these branching points with *diamonds*, while the other steps are represented with *rectangles*. The starting and ending steps are represented with *oval*.\n",
        "\n",
        "But before you learn about flow control statements, you first need to learn how to represent those *yes* and *no* options, and you need to understand how to write those branching points as Python code. To that end, let’s explore *Boolean values*, *comparison operators*, and *Boolean operators*.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Boolean Values\n",
        "\n",
        "While the integer, floating-point, and string data types have an unlimited number of possible values, the Boolean data type has only two values: `True` and `False`. When typed as Python code, the Boolean values `True` and `False` lack the quotes you place around strings, and they always start with a capital T or F, with the rest of the word in lowercase. \n",
        "\n",
        "Like any other value, *Boolean values* are used in expressions and can be stored in variables."
